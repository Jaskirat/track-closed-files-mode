* Track & Restore recently closed files

This minor mode when enabled, will track recently closed files in
emacs and enable you to restore them. 

Inspired by the Ctrl-Shift-T feature available in all modern browsers
today. 

C-S-y is an alternative key binding which can be used to show the list
of recently closed files and assist in choosing one of those.
